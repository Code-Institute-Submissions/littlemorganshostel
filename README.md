# Little Morgans Hostel

This is a fully responsive website that is a prototype for a real business called Little Morgans Hostel. This project is for the User-Centric Frontend Development Module at the Code Institute. Find a live demo [here.](https://isaacwoodruff.github.io/littlemorganshostel)


## UX

My objective for this website was to create an online presence and persuade visitors to either book a room or make contact. It was given a minimalistic design so that it was simple and intuitive for users to interact with. I chose a mobile first approach because most travellers would be using their mobile to look for rooms.


I wanted to provide them with a small bit of info at the start to stop them from getting bored and to keep them interested with a video of what the local area is like. I gave them a quick view of the facilities available. At the end of the facilities section I placed a BOOK A ROOM button as a call to action. I wanted them to see feedback from other guests so they could judge from others experiences so I added a reviews section. I want guests to have a way to contact the hostel with any questions so I added a contact form and then contact info in the footer.

### User Stories

A traveller visiting Ometepe Island in Nicaragua decides that he wants to find a hostel to stay at that offers food and drinks.


* I want to know what the rooms and facilities look like so I click on Facilities in the navigation bar at the top of the page which brings me to the facilities section with pictures and information about each facility.

* I want to book a room so I look for a link in the navigation bar which brings me to Little Morgans page on HostelWorld.com that shows a booking system.

* I want to ask the hostel a question so I look for a contact link in the navigation bar which brings me to a contact form. Underneath the contact form I can see the phone number and email address of the hostel. Next to these are links to the social media pages of the hostel which I can choose to contact them through.

* I want to see how other people found their stay at the hostel so I look for a reviews section on the site and find reviews of peoples experiences.


### Wireframe

For the wireframe I used Figma. You can find a demo [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/O7nG50WtbLtGdR44jEKAUl2A/Little-Morgans-Hostel?node-id=7%3A34&scaling=scale-down).


I designed the wireframe for a mobile version of the site. It helped me a lot to get a more solid idea for the layout and style of the site. I made some changes throughout the development but the structure is still very similiar.


## Features

### Existing Features
* **Responsive and fixed-top navbar:** Fully responsive navbar with a fixed-top ONLY on smaller devices.
